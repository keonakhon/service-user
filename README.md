This was a project that I attempted to implement in 2020 for my side project. I followed the error handler from this blog, which focused on the implementation on the Frontend. You can find it at https://productionreadygraphql.com/2020-08-01-guide-to-graphql-errors. However, this repository only focuses on the implementation on the Backend side.

- TypeScript
- Mongoose
- Jest
